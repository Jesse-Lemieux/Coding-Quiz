# Coding-Quiz

## This quiz is designed to test your coding smarts, with an extra bit of challenge, due to the timer.

  My motivation for this app was to really challeneg my knowledge of everything i learned about javascript over the past couple of weeks.
  I had to find ways to use intervals, arrays, java script inserted documents, even things from the past like CSS to hide certain elements.
  Some problems i solved during this project are how to use local storage, how to call a function on a set interval and how to hide
  certain elements when needed.
  
 # Some things I learned are:
    How to call to hide an element easily, in my case it was to make a CSS class called ".hide", with the properties of "display: none"
    and call for it when need be.
    How to access local storage on a seperate page. Luckily, local storage is,.. well local! so you can access it from any page.
    How to use setInterval. Here i just threw the setInterval onto a variable of it's own at 1000 milliseconds and called for
    it in my timer function.
